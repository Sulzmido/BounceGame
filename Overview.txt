Bounce Game.

	Bounce Game is a game with multiple levels.
All the level data is initiallly loaded in by the Level class
and is stored in an array of ArrayLists.

	The TileManager class access this ArrayLists based on
which level is currently playing and converts the level's
ArrayList data into a 2D Array data for easy accessiblilty
and manipulation.

	The BackgroundManager handles the background image wraparound
whose movestep is unique to other moving entities.

	The Game class co-ordinates all the game entities and
uses FSEM(Full Screen Exclusive Mode) and also handles input.
It also has the 'big' method for level transition.

	The Ballsprite class handles the ball. the move step of the ball
is the same as the move step of the tile map. This makes tile wraparound
and ball positioning in tile map calculation easier.

	The work of a statechart on the ballsprite class is obvious 
from its update() method.

	The ImageManager class handles ImageLoading and PlayMusic 
class handles WAV and MIDI audio loading using constants to differentiate
the audio formats internally.

	The Obstacles class observes the level's 2D array data and 
inits obstacles based on it. The char 'o' represent a tile where
an obstacle should be. The obstacles are animated with the star
images. The obstacles are also drawn with the help of TileManager.

	The Tile class defines a tile object and gives it different
qualities.    

	The movement coding of the ball does not make controlling
the ball "smooth" while the game is being played. The movement which
was roughly implemented by a statechart could be improved a lot more.
But i think making the bounce game is taking too much of my time, so
im leaving the movement as it is. 

   Pretty much all there is to this side scroller. :=)
